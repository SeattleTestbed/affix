Module: Node Manager connection handling.   This does everything up to handling
        a request (i.e. accept connections, handle the order they should be
        processed in, etc.)   Requests will be handled one at a time.

Start date: August 28th, 2008

This is the node manager for Seattle.   It ensures that sandboxes are correctly
assigned to users and users can manipulate those sandboxes safely.   

The design goals of this version are to be secure, simple, and reliable (in 
that order).   

The basic design of the node manager is that the accept portion (implemented
using waitforconn) accepts 
connections and checks basic things about them such as there aren't too many 
connections from a single source.   This callback places valid connections into
an ordered list.   This callback handles meta information like sceduling 
requests and preventing DOS attacks that target admission.

Another thread (the worker thread) processes the first element in the list.  
The worker thread is responsible for handling an individual request.   This
ensures that the request is validly signed, prevents slow connections from 
clogging the request stream, etc.


Right now I ensure that only one worker thread is active at a time.   In the 
future, it would be possible to have multiple threads that are performing 
disjoint operations to proceed in parallel.   This may allow starvation attacks
if it involves reordering the list of connections.   As a result, it is punted 
to future work.

I'm going to use "polling" by the worker thread.   I'll sleep when the 
list is empty and periodically look to see if a new element was added.

##### ORDER IN WHICH CONNECTIONS ARE HANDLED

# Each connection should be handled after all other IP addresses with this
# number of connections.   So if the order of requests is IP1, IP1, IP2 then 
# the ordering should be IP1, IP2, IP1.   
# For example, if there are IP1, IP2, IP3, IP1, IP3, IP3 then IP4 should be
# handled after the first IP3.   If IP2 adds a request, it should go in the 
# third to last position.   IP3 cannot currently queue another request since 
# it has 3 pending.



# This is a list that has the order connections should be handled in.   This
# list contains IP addresses (corresponding to the keys in the connection_dict)

# maps to a list of connections that are pending for that IP.

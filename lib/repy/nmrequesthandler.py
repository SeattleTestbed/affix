Module: Node Manager request handler.   This securely handles a request from a 
        client.   It does not worry about how it gets the connection, 
        concurrency, etc.   It does worry about slow retrieval attacks, etc.

Start date: August 28th, 2008

The design goals of this version are to be secure, simple, and reliable (in 
that order).   

I think this is fairly straightforward...   Get requests, check them, and
pass them to the appropriate API function

# I'm going to have a table that defines what to check for the calls.   
# The idea is to make the logic as clear as possible and punt the "decision 
# making" about what needs to be checked into the table.

# The format of a request is:
#    requesttype|arg1|arg2 ... 
# requests are protected using the signeddata mechanism, so a trailer contains
# the signature information

# Entries are key / values like requesttype: (numargs, whocanperform, function)
# request type is the string that identifies which request
# numargs is the number of args that the string must have
# whocanperform is either 'Public', 'User', 'Owner' and specifies the minimum
#               amount of privilege one must have to perform the action
# function is the function that should be called with the arguments

# NOTE: if whocanperform is 'User' or 'Owner' the first argument MUST be the
# vessel name...

# Calls that the node manager understands.   The key is the "call name"
# the value is a tuple with number of args, protection, and the actual function
